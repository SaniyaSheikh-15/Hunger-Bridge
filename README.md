A platform connecting restaurants with surplus food to NGOs and food banks, reducing waste and fighting hunger.
# 🍽 Food Waste Reducer

# Problem Statement
Every day, restaurants, cafes, and event organizers generate large amounts of surplus food that often goes to waste. Meanwhile, millions of people face hunger and food insecurity. This project aims to reduce the gap by connecting *restaurants with surplus food* to *NGOs and food banks* that can redistribute it to those in need.

# Solution
Food Waste Reducer is a platform designed to:  
- Enable restaurants to *post surplus food* (type, quantity, expiry time, location).  
- Allow NGOs/Food Banks to *browse and claim food donations* nearby.
- Citizens can report hunger spots → slums, old-age homes, shelters, or even needy families. 
- Send *real-time notifications* when food is available.  
- Provide an *impact dashboard* that tracks meals saved and CO₂ emissions reduced.  

This solution reduces food wastage, fights hunger, and contributes to environmental sustainability.
